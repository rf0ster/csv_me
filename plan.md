We are going to be creating a new python application that will be used to manage csv files. It will be used for cleaning, transforming, splitting, merging, and analyzing csv files. It should be built as a cli tool using the 'rich' library for better output and formatting. The application will be structured in a modular way, with separate modules for each functionality (cleaning, transforming, splitting, merging, analyzing or other features).

The application will have the following features:
- The application should take a csv file as an input argument. If one is not provided, it should prompt the user to enter the path to the csv file.
- The application will dispaly a menu of options for the user to choose from. When the user selects an option, the corresponding module for that functionality will dispaly a sub-menu with specific options for that functionality.
- The application should never modify the original csv file. Each time any transformation is applied, a new csv file should be created with the changes.
- When a functionality or transformation is applied, the application should provide a quick summary of the changes made, but nothing to overwhelm the CLI display.
- When a functionality or transformation is applied, the next transformation or functionality should be applied to the most recently created csv file, not the original one. This way, the user can chain multiple transformations together without worrying about losing their original data. But each step of the process should still be saved as a new csv file for fidelity and traceability.
- The final output of the application should be a folder containing all the csv files created during the process, with clear and descriptive names for each file to indicate the transformations applied.
- There should also be a log file that keeps track of all the transformations applied, along with timestamps and any relevant details about the changes made. Every change. This log file should be updated each time a transformation is applied, providing a clear record of the entire process for future reference. It should be part of the output folder upon completion of the process.
- Make sure that when the user navigates menus, the CLI display is clear and concise, and clears the screen between each menu to avoid clutter and confusion. The user should always be aware of which csv file they are currently working with, and the options available to them at each step of the process.
- The first set of features to implement are: 
    - Normalize Cols: This feature should provide a sub-menu with options to normalize cell values (e.g., converting to lowercase, replacing spaces with underscores, etc.) and a quick summary of the changes made. The sure should be able to select which columns to apply the normalization to, or apply it to all columns if they choose.
    - Normalize Phones: This feature should provide a sub-menu with options to normalize phone numbers (e.g., removing special characters, standardizing formats, etc.) and a quick summary of the changes made. The user should be able to select which columns to apply the normalization to, or apply it to all columns if they choose.
    - Normalize Currency: This feature should provide a sub-menu with options to normalize currency values (e.g., removing currency symbols, standardizing formats, etc.) and a quick summary of the changes made. The user should be able to select which columns to apply the normalization to, or apply it to all columns if they choose. 
    - Remove Duplicates: This feature should provide a sub-menu with options to remove duplicate rows based on specific columns or the entire row, and a quick summary of the changes made. By default, the sub-menu should be set to remove duplicates based on the entire row, but the user should have the option to un-select specific columns to consider as a duplicate value for removal if they choose.
    - Split Column: This feature should allow the user to select a single column to split. The user is prompted for one or more separator characters (entered in single quotes, e.g. ' ', ',', '_', '-'). The user is then asked to name the new columns that will be created from the split. The split data fills the new columns. If any row produces more parts than the number of new columns provided, that row is left unsplit (original value stays in the source column, new columns are empty for that row). The tool logs how many rows could not be split and provides a summary to the user.
    - Join CSVs: This feature allows the user to combine the current working CSV with one or more external CSV files. The user can add files to a join queue, view a summary of queued files and the union of all columns, and optionally exclude specific columns before executing the join. The result is a single CSV with the union of all columns from all files — rows from files missing a column get blank values for that column. The user can preview the result before saving.
